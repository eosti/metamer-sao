# PY32
This is the code use for the bootstrap I2C MCU. 
It's the PY32F002B, so the cheapest one possible. 

The structure of the repo is largely taken from [py32f0-template](https://github.com/IOsetting/py32f0-template) -- I still don't know how Makefiles work, and that's okay. 
Building is as easy as `make`.
