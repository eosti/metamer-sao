# Metamer SAO
A collection of files related to the [Metamer SAO](https://reidsoxharris.me/projects/metamer-sao)

The `schematics` directory has PDFs of the schematics, the `board-files` directory has all the files you might need for fabrication and assembly including a BOM, and the `generators` directory contains the code used for auto-generating code for doing things like normalizing brightness. 

As always, more to come.
